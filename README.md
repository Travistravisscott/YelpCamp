Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, EJS, Passport.js, Cloudinary, Mapbox

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that allows users to explore, create, and review campgrounds from anywhere across the globe. 
Inspired by the Yelp experience, it serves as a centralized hub for nature lovers and adventure seekers to find and share beautiful camping spots.

🚀 Features:
🌐 Global Campground Listings – Browse user-submitted campgrounds from all around the world.

🧾 User Authentication – Secure login/signup using Passport.js (local strategy).

✍️ CRUD Functionality – Logged-in users can add, edit, or delete their campgrounds and comments.

📸 Image Upload – Upload campground images using Cloudinary.

🗺️ Interactive Maps – Map integration with Mapbox for location-based views.

🧹 Clean UI – Dynamic EJS templating and responsive design for seamless UX.

🛡️ Security – Implemented data sanitization, validation, and authorization checks

💻 What I Built:
I built YelpCamp from scratch using the complete MERN-like stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and EJS for templating), implementing RESTful routing, middleware architecture, and third-party integrations like Cloudinary and Mapbox.
This project not only deepened my understanding of backend logic and database design but also honed my skills in building scalable and secure applications.
